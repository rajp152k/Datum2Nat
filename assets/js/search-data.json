            "content": "At the point of drafting this, I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Artificial Intelligence and I believe technical blogging is a great way to get good as something while having some fun and consolidating all that I learn along the way. . That was the primary intention of this blog when I set it up(long ago) and still holds true. However, I never commenced writing because I felt like I never knew much about a specific relevant topic to write about that would interest the readers; A lot of pre-existing blogs already have a lot of that base covered. . Of course, that is a very stupid thing to say: everyone’s got to start somewhere. So I’ve decided to ditch the act of playing an expert and pose these streams of thoughts in more playful, flexible ways with a beginner’s mindset, drawing upon curiosity and introspection instead of only relying upon the normal route of pedagogical write-ups. . To be clear, I definitely will have technical posts to support any hypothesis that I would like to explore but am also looking forward to have an opinionated outlook towards them and build intuition along the way. . Data and Information transcend the scope of current trends and date back, meta-physically speaking, way before we started identifying them as a prominent presence. Now, in my effort to understand these two entities philosophically, while trying to convey what I think of them, I definitely am being overtly ambitious. . But that’s where the fun lies - I am writing this just because a whim swayed me to the idea of taking a super-meta approach to data and trying to view it through all lenses. . Definitely amped-up to find out what this branch of my blog morphs into. I have no plan. .",
